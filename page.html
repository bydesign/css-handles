		<h2>Chapter 1: Loomings</h2>
	    <p>
	      Call me Ishmael. Some years ago&mdash;never mind how long precisely&mdash;having
	      little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
	      shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
	      the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the
	      circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever
	      it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself
	      involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear
	      of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an
	      upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me
	      from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
	      people's hats off&mdash;then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon
	      as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical
	      flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship.
	      There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men
	      in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings
	      towards the ocean with me.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves
	      as Indian isles by coral reefs&mdash;commerce surrounds it with her surf.
	      Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is
	      the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by
	      breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the
	      crowds of water-gazers there.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears
	      Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do
	      you see?&mdash;Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand
	      thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some
	      leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking
	      over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as
	      if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all
	      landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster&mdash;tied to counters,
	      nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green
	      fields gone? What do they here?
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
	      seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the
	      extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder
	      warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as
	      they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand&mdash;miles of
	      them&mdash;leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys,
	      streets and avenues&mdash;north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all
	      unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses
	      of all those ships attract them thither?
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take
	      almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale,
	      and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let
	      the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries&mdash;stand
	      that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead
	      you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be
	      athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan
	      happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one
	      knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.
